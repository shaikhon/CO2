# CO2 Dashboard

Webpage Link: https://net0thon.streamlit.app/

Description:
This repo is a webpage to a dashboard to track CO2 abatement rates in Saudi Arabia. This webpage was built as part of a solution to a climate-change hackathon (*Net0thon*) organized by Saudi Aramco in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on May 28th, 2023.

Objective:
Using this webpage you can test different scenarios of CO2 abatement strategies to accelarate the Kingdom's targets of:
1. Reducing/offsetting emissions by 278 million tons of CO2 by 2030
2. Acheive net-zero by 2060

Features:
- Graph of historical population and CO2 emissions (source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/))
- Graph of future forecasts of population, CO2 emissions and CO@ abatement rates in Saudi Arabia using facebook [prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) 
- Map visualization of CO2 emissions from the leading industrial sectors (source: [Rowaihy et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590174522001222))
- Collected data of local CO2 sequesteration efforts
